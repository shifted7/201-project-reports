## Project Report #4
# Progress
- Our team made a lot of progress today. We finished the functionality of the "park", where the dogs meet to interact. We also fixed a good number of bugs.

# Specific Contributions
- Today I mostly worked on the park functionality and bug fixes. I did some pair programming with Teddy.

# Most Challenging
- Most challenging today was trying to hunt down a specific bug. I really had to get in there with console logs to figure it out, and it took hours. It didn't help that the bug was introduced by code I added, and everyone had to wait for me to fix it before the code would work. Frustrating for the whole team I think.
